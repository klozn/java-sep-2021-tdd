# Codelab02: TicTacToe

Create a program that checks if a player has won with tic tac toe.
Possible outcomes you should print:
- Player X has won the game.
- Player O has won the game.
- No one has won the game.

a player can win the game if he has 3 items in one row.

Run the tests!

If you want to take it up a notch try to check if it is a valid game.
