# Recursive functions

A method that is declared in a class can be called from everywhere in that class.
So a method can also be called from within his own body!
Methods that call themselves are called **recursive functions**.

## An example
```java
public class Recursive {
    
    public int getANumber(int startingPoint) {
        if(startingPoint > 10) {
            return 10;
        }
        return getANumber(startingPoint + 1);
    }
}
```

## Rules
Recursive functions are fairly simple and contain typically two parts.
1. The top part of a recursive function is the **stopping condition**. 
    * Because if you don't have a stopping condition your recursions (repetitions) will never stop.
2. The second part is the **recursion part**.
    * Here you'll do some calculations and finally call yourself again.
    
That's it you're now ready to create your own recursive functions.

## Warning!
While some language are meant to work with recursions java isn't.
The number of recursions is always limited in java.
If you do to many recursion you'll get a **StackOverflowException**.
But don't worry as long you keep the repitions under 7000 you should be fine.
