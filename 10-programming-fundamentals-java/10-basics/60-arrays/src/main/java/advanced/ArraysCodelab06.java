     * Implement this method so that it transforms an array of length 2 to an array of length 10.
     *
     * All elements that were in the initial array need to be also in the new array.
     * If the input array isn't of length 2 do nothing and just return the input array.
     *
     * 1. The happy path is that you assume that all input arrays are of length 2.
     * 2. You check if the length is 2 and return the input array if that is not the case.
     *
     * Visual example:
     * Say you have the following array [12, 24]
     *
     * In the memory this will look like this:
     *   memory address      value in memory
     *      XX0                     12 <- pointer too start of array
     *      XX1                     24
     *
     * And the returned array will look something like this:
     *   memory address      value in memory
     *      XX0                     12 <- pointer too start of array
     *      XX1                     24
     *      XX2                      0
