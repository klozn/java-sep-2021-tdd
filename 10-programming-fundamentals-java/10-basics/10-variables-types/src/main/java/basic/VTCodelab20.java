        // Bobby Bento is 24 years old, lives in Antwerp, has 23,46â‚¬ in his account and has opted out of receive adds through mail.
        // Think of the naming conventions and SRP when choosing the names of your variables!

        // Hint: You can also use a new Type called String in this one, it works like char but values are denoted with " instead of '
        // Like so: String helloWorld = "Hello World"
    }
