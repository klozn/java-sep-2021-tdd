     * This application for tending to a fancy villa is a mess.
     *      All classes are in a big pile.
     *      Encapsulation is non-existent.
     * <p>
     * Let's clean it up:
     *      1. Separate the classes into different packages
     *      2. Encapsulate as much as possible (private if possible, then package private, then protected, if nothing else goes finally public)
     *
     * Bonus (advanced) exercise:
     *      The gardener became sick suddenly, but the garden needs urgent tending.
     *      Luckily the butler has some gardening skills.
     *      How hard would it be to let the butler tend to the gardens?
     *
     *      Try to refactor the code in such a way that you don't have any getters or setters.
     *      Using too many getters or setters is a sign of feature envy/message chain (code smells).
     *      See: https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells/couplers for more information.
     *
     *      What would be the benefit in writing your codebase without any getters or setters?
     *
     *      After this change how hard is it make the gardener once again responsible for the garden?
