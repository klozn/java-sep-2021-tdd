     * The goal of this codelab is the gain some insight on Object references.
     * Therefore, don't yet execute the main method!
     * First, do the following:
     *      1. Determine what the printed output will be and why!
     *      2. Draw on a piece of paper which variables (holding references) point to which objects (as we did on the slides)
     *      3. Only then execute the code and validate whether your solutions from step 1 and 2 were correct!
     *          - To execute the code, turn the code on line 17 into a comment (or simply remove it)
