/**
 * The goal of this codelab is the gain some insight on Object equality (equals method)
 * Therefore, don't yet execute the main method!
 * First, do the following:
 *      1. Determine which statements will result to true and which to false
 *      2. Only then execute the code and validate whether your answers were correct
 *          - To execute the code, turn the code on line 14 into a comment (or simply remove it)
