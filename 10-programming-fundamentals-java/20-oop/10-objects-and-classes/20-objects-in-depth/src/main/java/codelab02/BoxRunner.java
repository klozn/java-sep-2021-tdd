/**
 * Take a piece of paper and draw boxes (like on the slides) for all the objects
 * that are in play (memory) just before the end of the main method (line 49).
 *
 *    E.g.:
 *    --------------------
 *    |     Rectangle    |
 *    |     ----------   |
 *    |     x: 1         |    <-----   myBox
 *    |     y: 2         |
 *    |     width: 10    |
 *    |     height: 5    |
 *    --------------------
 *
 * How many Rectangle objects exist? How many Point objects?
 * What is the output of the program?
 *
 * At the end of the main method, are the p1 and p2 references equal?
 *      - So really the question is: do they point to the same object in the heap?
 *      - Yes or no? Why?
 * If you think you know the answer, write a line of code to make sure!
 *
 * At the end of the main method, are the p1 and p2 objects equal?
 *      - So really the question is: are the objects themselves equal (based on (a part of) their state)
 *      - Yes or no? Why?
 * If you think you know the answer, write a line of code to make sure!
