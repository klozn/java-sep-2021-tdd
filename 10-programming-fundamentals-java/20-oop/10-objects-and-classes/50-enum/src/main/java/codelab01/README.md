# Genderenum

## Human

Create a `Human` class. It has the following instance fields:
- firstname
- lastname
- gender

The `firstname` and `lastname` hold textual values, field `gender` holds a value of enum `Gender`.

In `Human`, create a (3-arg) constructor that offers for every field an argument.

Override the `toString` method of `Human` to return the following String: "{firstname} {lastname} has gender {gender}"

## Gender
To keep things simple, enum type `Gender` will only have defined 3 values:
- MALE
- FEMALE
- OTHER

Create `Gender` and its values.


## Application

Create a main method in which you create at least 3 `Human` objects. Give each object a different gender.
Then, print these objects to the console.
