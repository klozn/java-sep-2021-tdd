     * ------------------
     *
     * Create a checkerboard (black and red tiles) using BigWindow, BigCanvas and BigSquare.
     * The checkerboard should dynamically generate tiles based on the BigWindow's dimensions.
     * Feel free to create extra (helper) methods if you feel they will help you write
     * cleaner / better / simpler code.
