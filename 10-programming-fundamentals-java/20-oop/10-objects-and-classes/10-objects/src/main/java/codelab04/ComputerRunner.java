/**
 * Do the following
 * ------------------
 * 1. Start by creating a main method.
 * 2. Then create 4 different computers (Computer objects)
 *      - A generic computer
*       - A computer of brand "Sony", don't specify a price
 *      - A computer with price 88800 (in dollarCents), don't specify the brand
 *      - A computer with brand "Apple" and with price (in dollarCents) 159500
 *
 * 3. For every computer, call the toString() method and print the result
 *
 * Tip: instead of manually, 4 times, calling the toString() method for every computer
 * try and store the Computer objects you created inside an array and then loop (for-each)
 * over that array, each time calling the toString() method and printing the result
