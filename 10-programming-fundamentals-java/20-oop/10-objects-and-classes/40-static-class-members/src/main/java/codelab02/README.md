# MyRectangle

Start by creating a `MyRectangle` class.

## Requirement 1
I should be able to create a MyRectangle object without providing any arguments.

## Requirement 2
I should be able to create a MyRectangle object by providing a X and Y coordinate
- The dimensions should be 50 for width and 100 for height then

## Requirement 3
I should be able to create a MyRectangle object by providing a width and weight
- The coordinates should be 5 for X and 10 for Y then

## Requirement 4
I should be able to create a MyRectangle object by providing the coordinates and dimensions

## Requirement 5
Make sure no-one can directly access the instance variables outside of your MyRectangle class

## Requirement 6
Create getters for all instance variables

## Requirement 7
Create a method that sets both the width and height to the provided new values

## Requirement 8
Create a method that calculates and returns the area

## Requirement 9
Create two new methods:
1. A method to set the name (or label) of the MyRectangle instance
2. A method to get the name (or label) of the MyRectangle instance

## Requirement 10
Create a method that, as an argument, takes a MyRectangle object and duplicates it.
- With duplicating, we mean a new MyRectangle object should be created with the values of the provided one
    - This new MyRectangle object should be returned
- Question: Should it be an instance method or a class method?

## Requirement 11
Create a way so we can ask MyRectangle how many instances / objects have been created of MyRectangle.
- This means, that every time we create a new instance of MyRectangle, we have to keep count.
