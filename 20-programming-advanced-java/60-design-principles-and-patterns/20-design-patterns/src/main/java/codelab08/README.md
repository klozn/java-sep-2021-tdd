# Driving Sim

Expand the provided code with extra functionality:
- Implement an **UNDO** operation for each of the following behavior
    - a driver enters a car
    - a driver leaves a car
    - the car's lights are turned on
    - the car's lights are turned off
    - the car's engine is turned on
    - the car's engine is turned off
    - the car's driven for a certain amount of miles

Refactor the code, using a behavioral design pattern, so that it works just as before (there are tests to assure this), 
but also supports the newly required **undo** behavior

We haven't yet covered this design pattern.

No clue which pattern to use?
- Decode the following string with **Base64** (source charset: UTF-8) to get your answer
	- `bWVtZW50bw==`
