# Fill me up!

You have 3 classes that you cannot change:

- Car with a method fillMeUp();
- Bus with a method fillMeAlready();
- Truck with a method fillMeSlowImOnABreak();

We already have a ServiceStation class that has a Fill method for which we can fill a Truck.
- We now want it to be able to fill a Car or Bus instance as well... However, we don't want to change the Fill method.

Which Structural pattern can we use?
- Tip: we didn't yet cover this one...
- Tip: You also use it with your laptop or when on vacation (in some countries like USA or GB)

No clue which pattern to use?
