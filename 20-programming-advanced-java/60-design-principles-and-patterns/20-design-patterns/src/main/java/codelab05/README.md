# Files and Directory

Create a File and Directory tree structure for which we can print the contents.
- Printing the contents of a directory should delegate (most of) its work to its children
- Printing the contents of a file should simply print "File <name>".

Example output:
```
|-- Directory X
    |-- File A
    |-- File B
    |-- Directory C
        |-- File K
        |-- File L
    |-- File D 
```

Which Structural pattern can we use?

No clue which pattern to use?
- Decode the following string with **Base64** (source charset: UTF-8) to get your answer
