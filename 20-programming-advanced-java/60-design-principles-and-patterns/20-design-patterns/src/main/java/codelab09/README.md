# Movie Rental

Let's revisit the Movie Rental exercise (because it's so fun)

Inspect the code, improve it (the code itself, not the functionality) any way you can (refactor).

- Tip 1: Think about (GRASP) responsibilities (information expert)
- Tip 2: Think about flexibility (changing a movie's price code should remain possible)
- Tip 3: Think about SOLID (open/closed principle)
- Tip 4: Inheritance on the level of Movie might get you far, but not far enough. Can you apply the Strategy design pattern as a better alternative?

Start by running (and expanding if needed) the existing tests.
