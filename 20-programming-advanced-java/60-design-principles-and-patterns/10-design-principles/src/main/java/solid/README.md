# SOLID

For every exercise:
- Decide what piece of code violates the specified SOLID principle
- Refactor the code so that it no longer violates the principle

Just so you know:
- Solutions are provided, only take a look at them when you think you're completely 
done with your own solution. Don't look at the solutions when you're stuck...
