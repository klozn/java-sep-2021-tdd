# Design Principle

1. Decide what piece of code violates the SOLID - **Dependency Inversion Principle**.
2. Refactor the code so that it no longer violates the principle.
3. Make it so that a Button can operate on (toggle) other devices as well, not just a Lamp (e.g. a Fan)

(And yes, for the sake of the exercise it's OK for a Button to have a Lamp and not visa-versa)
