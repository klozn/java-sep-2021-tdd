# Lambda expressions
- I can create and use lambda expressions
    - I understand that a lambda expression is not much more than a nameless method.
    - I know how to write a lambda expression as a parameter (by using a functional interface) for an existing method
    - I know the syntax of a lambda expression:
            - I can create a lambda with one parameter with one line statement as a body
            - I can create a lambda with no parameters
            - I can create a lambda with multiple parameters
            - I can create a lambda with a multi-line statement as a body
    - I can create my own methods expecting a lambda expression and use them with lambda expressions
    - I can create my own functional interfaces
        - I use the @FunctionalInterface annotation when doing so
    - I know (some of) the existing functional interfaces
