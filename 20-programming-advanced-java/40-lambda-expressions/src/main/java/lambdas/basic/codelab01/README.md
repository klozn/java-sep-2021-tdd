# Sorting

Create a simple class `Footballer` that has 2 fields:
- AttackingScore (goes from 0 - 100)
- DefendingScore (goes from 0 - 100)

Create a class `Team` that has as its field a list of footballers and several methods:
- A method that sorts the list of footballers from best to worst attacking
- A method that sorts the list of footballers from worst to best attacking
- A method that sorts the list of footballers from best to worst defending
- A method that sorts the list of footballers from worst to best defending
- A method that sorts the list of footballers from best to worst **averaging**

**Essential Tip:** on any instance of `List` there is a method available to sort. You'll need it. 
For each different sorting need (the 5 above methods), feed it a different lambda expression.
