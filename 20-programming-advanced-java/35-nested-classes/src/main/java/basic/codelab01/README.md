# Musician

1. Create the class `Musician` with a nested class `Instrument`
2. Add the method `makeNoise()` to the nested class `Instrument`
3. Add the method `play()` to the `Musician`, this method will create a new instance of `Instrument` and calls the `makeNoise()` method.

Given the above (strict) requirements:
4. Should Instrument be a static nested class or a inner class?
5. Should Instrument be public, or can it be private?
