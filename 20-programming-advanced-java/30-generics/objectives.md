# Generics
- I know how to use existing generic classes
    - I can create a object from a generic class with a provided type
    - I know the difference between using the raw-type (Object) and using a specific type.
- I know how to create my own generic classes
    - I can define a type parameter in my class
    - I can use that type as a parameter type of a method
    - I can use that type as a return type
- I know how to create my own generic methods
    - I can define a type parameter on my method
    - I can use that type as a parameter
    - I can use that type as a return type
- I can generalise another generic class
    - I can implement a generic interface
    - I can extend from a generic (abstract) class
- I understand the basics of a bounded type and can use them
    - I know with which types I can create an object of a generic class with bounded type parameters.
- I understand the basics of a wildcard bounded generic type in combination with data-structures
    - I know which types of a List I can provide to method having a wildcard bounded generic type
