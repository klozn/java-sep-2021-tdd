# Strict bank account

Create a class that represents a (banking) account.

Creating a bank account is not easy, the following validation rules apply:
- The owner (Person) should be at least 18 years old
- The owner (Person) should have a first and last name
- The owner (Person) should have an address
- The bank account should have a starting amount higher than 250 (euro).

If a validation rule is broken, a custom (user-defined) banking account validation exception should arise

Implement all the different validation rules, 
but always first write a test for a validation rule and only then implement it.
