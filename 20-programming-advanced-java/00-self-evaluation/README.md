# Self Evaluation 2

This self evaluation is created for the purpose of self reflection and to match your current level 
of programming against our expectations. 

You will have 2 dedicated days to complete it. 
Should that not be enough, we expect you to finish it after-hours / over the weekend.

This self evaluation is in no means a 'classic' test in which the received grades are the most important aspect.
Therefore, the self evaluation will not be graded in a numerical way. However, you will receive extensive feedback 
on your solutions which you should review in-depth!

This self evaluation is based on a benchmark of already seen, essential codelabs. You should make sure to solve all of these codelabs! 
Most likely, some (if not most) of these codelabs you will have already solved before. First, solve the remaining unfinished codelabs. 
Then, redo some of the codelabs you had already solved before and compare your new solution with your previous solution. 
Your new solution will most likely be better, as you can apply new knowledge, techniques you didn't know the first time.

In **this file**, please replace every :x: with a check mark :heavy_check_mark: `:heavy_check_mark:` when you have created a solution for it.
Please do this after each finished codelab. It will help us in keeping track of your progress.
