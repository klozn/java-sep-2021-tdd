# Data Structures
- I can choose and use the right data structure based on my requirements
    - I have a good understanding of the high-level data structures: list, map / dictionary, set, queue, stack,...
        - I know that I can use a List to have an **ordered** group of elements
        - I know that I can use a Set to have a group of **unique** elements on which I can do mathematical operations
        - I know that a Queue can be used to **store** elements (before processing)
        - I know that I can use a Map to store key-value pairs, which allows for quick key-based look-ups.  
- I know some general specifics
    - I know about util classes like Collections, Arrays and how to use them
    - When I write data structures I write against an interface
- I can use concrete implementations of the Data structure interfaces provided in Java
    - E.g. ArrayList<E>, HashMap<K, V>,...
