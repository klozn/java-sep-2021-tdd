# Sorting

_Disclaimer: This is an optional codelab for those who want an extra challenge._

> From the beginning of computing, the sorting problem has attracted a great deal of research, perhaps due to the complexity of solving it efficiently despite its simple, familiar statement.
Sorting algorithms are prevalent in introductory computer science classes. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms and for human-readable output.

We're going to write our own implementations of popular sorting algorithms.

Implement the Insertion, Selection and Bubble sort algorithms:

1. Write tests (they should be easy to write)
2. Don't change to `SortingApplication` class

We have already provided the 3 classes (SelectionSort, InsertionsSort and BubbleSort) 
in which you can implement the sorting algorithms.

It might help you to do some research on Selection, Insertion and Bubble sort.

After implementing, make sure to run your sorting algorithms. You may add timings (see the previous codelab) 
to see how long the algorithms run (relatively to each other).

## Selection sort

Algorithm (Flow):
1. Find the smallest number. Swap it with the first number.
2. Find the second-smallest number. Swap it with the second number.
3. Find the third-smallest number. Swap it with the third number.
4. Repeat finding the next-smallest number, and swapping it into the correct position until the array is sorted.

- When is selection sort less efficient?

## Insertion sort

Algorithm (Flow) in pseudo-code:
```
i ← 1
while i < length(A)
    j ← i
    while j > 0 and A[j-1] > A[j]
        swap A[j] and A[j-1]
        j ← j - 1
    end while
    i ← i + 1
end while
```
Where i = index and A = the list to sort

- When is insertion sort less efficient?

## Bubble sort

Algorithm (Flow) in pseudo-code:
```
n = length(A)
    repeat 
        swapped = false
        for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
            /* if this pair is out of order */
            if A[i-1] > A[i] then
                /* swap them and remember something changed */
                swap( A[i-1], A[i] )
                swapped = true
            end if
        end for
    until not swapped
```
Where A = the list to sort
