# Word reader

Create a class `WordReader` that offers some useful class methods:

- A method that iterates over a given collection containing words (String), printing out every word.
    - It should work on all collections (`Collection` interface), so I should be able to call it by providing a list, set, queue,...
- A method that iterates over a given collection containing words (String) capitalizing every word: 
    - It should always return a **list** (no matter the type of the provided collection as argument) containing the capitalized words.
