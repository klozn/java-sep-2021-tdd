# Online Java Documentation

Go to the online Java Documentation (a.k.a. Java Docs). It's the online documentation portal for all Java's SDK API's.
- https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/ (this is the one for Java SDK 12)
- E.g. It's where you search for `ArrayList<E>` to see what public methods (API) it offers and what these methods do exactly (among other things)

Throughout versions (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,...), the API's can change. Certain classes and methods can be altered, removed (if they were deprecated). New classes and methods might have been added.

On the left, in the vertical menu, select `API Documentation`.

Then, on the top-right, start using the **search** functionality.

# Collection

1. Search for `Collection`, then select `java.util.Collection`
2. Scroll down on that page, you'll notice a lot of information is provided:
- Its package and module
- Its super-interfaces (parent)
- Its sub-interfaces (children)
- The classes that implement the `Collection` interface
- An extended description of what 'Collection' is.
- The (abstract) method it offers and a description for every such method.
- ...

Now, search for the following interfaces and classes:
- `List<E>`
- `ArrayList<E>`

For your information: all the data structures part of the Collections framework belong to the `java.util` package. 

It's not important to know all of these documentations by heart. 
However, you do need to find your way in them and use them to your own benefit.

Whenever you're using a new class that is part of the Java SDK, **take some time to read its documentation!**
- Really, do this! It's extremely useful and important.
