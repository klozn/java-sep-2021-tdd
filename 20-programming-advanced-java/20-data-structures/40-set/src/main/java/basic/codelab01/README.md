# Movie Catalog

1. Inspect classes `Movie` and `MovieCatalog`.
2. Then, inspect the tests: `MovieCatalogTest`.
3. It's your job to complete the `MovieCatalog` class so that all the tests succeed.

Small remark: you'll notice that 2 of the 3 methods you need to implement return an array of `Movie` objects, 
while you're working with a set. All Collections have (a) method(s) to return their elements as an array.
