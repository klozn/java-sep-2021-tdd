# TDD and clean code
- I can develop a java application in which I strive for quality and readability.
    - I can write an new requirement test-first
        - I understand the reason why to write code test-first
        - I understand the reason why one should maintain tests
        - I can split a complex assignment into a list of testable requirements
        - I know how to select a good requirement as a starting point
    - I can write code in pair
        - I can have the roll of both navigator and driver
        - I understand the benefits of pair programming
        - I understand the disadvantages of pair programming
        - I am open to pair with everyone in the team. Even if we differ a lot on a personal level
    - I know how to refactor
        - I can recognize the difference between clean code and difficult to read code
        - I understand the benefits of clean code
        - I can recognize some code smells
        - I know several basic refactoring techniques
            - extract variable
            - extract field
            - extract constant
            - extract method
            - extract class
            - inline variable
        - When I code I take time to refactor my code regularly, following the TDD cycle of writing a test, making it 
        work and then make it more pretty (refactor).
