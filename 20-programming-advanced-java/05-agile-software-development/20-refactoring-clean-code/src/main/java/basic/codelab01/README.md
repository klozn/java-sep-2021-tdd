# Nasty Battle

Although the code works, there are some code smells present.

The tests serve as the documentation, so study them closely.

- Make sure you understand the code!
- Find and refactor the code smells!
- Run the tests, make sure the tests still work afterwards
    - Refactor the tests if needed
    
When you think you're done, ask for feedback!
