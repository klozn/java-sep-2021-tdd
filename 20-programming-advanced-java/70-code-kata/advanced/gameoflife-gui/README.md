# Game of life

**Students: this README.md file is not for you...**

## Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.
The command below can be used if you want to further develop the Angular application.

### Build a new distribution

The `dist` folder is purposely put under version control. That way, students don't have to perform a `npm install`.
Build a new distribution using the following command: 
`ng build --prod --base-href /gameoflife-gui/`

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
