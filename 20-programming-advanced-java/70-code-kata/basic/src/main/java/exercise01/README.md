# Roman numerals

The Romans were people of conquest but some might forget they were also a people of engineering.  
They designed roads, bridges, aquaducts and even plumbing system that are still impressive to this day.

To make all these things, they of course needed maths and numbers.
But as you might know their number system was a bit different to our (arabic) system.

We've listed the differences below in the rules.

## Rules

```
"M" <-> "1000"
"D" <-> "500"
"C" <-> "100"
"L" <-> "50"
"X" <-> "10"
"V" <-> "5"
"I" <-> "1"

"MM"  <-> "2000"
"CC"  <-> "200"
"XX"  <-> "20"
"II"  <-> "2"

"MMM"  <-> "3000"
"CCC"  <-> "300"
"XXX"  <-> "30"
"III"  <-> "3"

"CM" <-> "900"
"CD" <-> "400"
"XC" <-> "90"
"XL" <-> "40"
"IX" <-> "9"
"IV" <-> "4"
```
## Examples
```
"MCDXLIV"  --> "M CD XL IV"  <-> "1444"
"MMCMXCIX" --> "MM CM XC IX" <-> "2999"
"DCCCXXIV" --> "D CCC XX IV" <-> "824"
```

## Exercise
Build a system that can convert Roman numerals to arabic numbers and vice versa.
