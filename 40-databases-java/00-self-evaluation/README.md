# Self evaluation 4: Örder

As the self evaluation, we'll re-develop the Örder application. But this time, we'll focus on the ORM part (and thus the domain).

- The actual assignment can be found in `60-projects/order`
- Start by creating your entire domain and properly implementing the ORM.
    - When you're finished with the domain and still have time left, implement the REST endpoints (and services,...)
- As your starting point, you can use a skeleton that's available on the Switchfully GitHub.
- Since this is a self evaluation exercise, work individually.
