# Spring dependency injection

Create a new Maven project
- GroupId = `com.switchfully.springdi`
- ArtifactId = `spring-dependency-injection`

## Create the following classes

(also read the extra requirements below)

- Create `TaxCalculator`
    - A `TaxCalculator` calculates the taxes based on a yearly income (provide a method for this)
    - For its calculation, a `TaxCalculator` uses a `TaxCalculation` instance.
        - Inject the `TaxCalculation` dependency (Constuctor Dependency Injection) 
- Create `TaxCalculation`
    - It offers a method which calculates the taxes based on a yearly income
    - There are 3 concrete `TaxCalculations`
        1. `AmericanTaxCalculation`
            - Tax rate of 18%, lump sum of 950  
            - Formule: `yearlyIncome * 0.18 + 950`        
        2. `BelgianTaxCalculation`
            - Tax rate of 45%
            - Formule: `yearlyIncome * 0.45`
        3. `FrenchTaxCalculation`
            - Tax rate of 48%
            - Formule: `yearlyIncome * 0.48`
            
## Extra Requirements (required)
         
- Write tests, and try using Mocking
- Use automatic component scanning
    - Both TaxCalculator and the different TaxCalculations should be discovered and made beans for
    - The default `TaxCalculation` is the `BelgianTaxCalculation`, 
    however, make sure the `AmericanTaxCalculation` is injected as the dependency for `TaxCalculator`
- Create a main method that calculates the taxes for in income of 23.000 (euro) 
    - Use the ApplicationContext to get the bean
